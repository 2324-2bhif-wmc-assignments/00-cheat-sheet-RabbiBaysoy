            <h3>1. What are the most essential technologies that made the World Wide Web such a success?</h3>
            <p> URL, HTTP and HTMl are the most essential technologies that made the World Wide Web successful.</p>

            <h3>2. How are resources (html pages, images, etc.) addressed in the web?</h3>
            <p> The resources are adressed with Uniform Resource Locators (URLs).</p>

            <h3>3. What are the general components of an url?</h3>
            <p>scheme: The scheme identifies the protocol to be used to access the resource. It can be HTTP or HTTPS.</p>
            <p>host: The host displays the IP address or domain of the server that leads to the resource.</p>
            <p>path: The path indicates the specific location in the server's directory.</p>

            <h3>1. What is a web server?</h3>
            <p>A web server is software and hardware that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and other protocols
                <br>to respond to client requests made over the World Wide Web. The main job of a web server is to <br>
                display website content through storing, processing and delivering webpages to users. Besides HTTP, <br>
                web servers also support SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) and FTP (File Transfer Protocol), used <br>
                for email, file transfer and storage.</p>

            <h3>2. What does a web server?</h3>
            <p>A Web server processes and manages HTTP/HTTPS requests and responses from the client system.</p>
            <h3>3. How can content be stored on a web server?</h3>
            <p>The simplest and most common way to store content on a web server is by saving files directly <br>
                to the server's file system. These files can include HTML documents, images, videos, JavaScript files,
                <br>CSS stylesheets, and more.</p>

            <h3>4. How is content in webpages described?</h3>
            <p>Content in webpages is usually described with a combination of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and <br>
                metadata.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>1. What is a web client?</h3>
            <p>A web client is an application that communicates with a web server, using Hypertext Transfer Protocol
                (HTTP). </p>

            <h3>2. What does a web client?</h3>
            <p> A web client requests web resources, renders and displays web content, enables user to interact with web
                <br> applications and websites, handles cookies and sessions, supports various protocols and displays
                <br> errors and status messages.</p>

            <h3>3. Web Client and Web Browser is the same</h3>
            <p>That is not correct. All web browsers are web clients, but not all web clients are web browsers. Web <br>
                clients encompass a broader category of software that can interact with web resources in various ways,
                <br> whereas web browsers are web clients specifically designed for rendering and displaying web content
                <br> in a user-friendly manner.</p>
