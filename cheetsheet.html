        <section>
            <h6>1. What is a web server?</h6>
            <p>A web server is software and hardware that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and other protocols
                to respond to client requests made over the World Wide Web.</p>
            <p>The main job of a web server is to display website content through storing, processing and delivering
                webpages to users.</p>
            <p>Besides HTTP, web servers also support SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
                and FTP (File Transfer Protocol), used for email, file transfer and storage.</p>
