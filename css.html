            <h6>CSS Selectors</h6>
            <p>CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.</p>
            <p>We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)</li>
                <li>Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)</li>
                <li>Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)</li>
                <li>Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)</li>
                <li>Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)</li>
            </ul>
