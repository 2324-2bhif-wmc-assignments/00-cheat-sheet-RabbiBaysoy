            <p>The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.The declaration block contains one or more 
                declarations separated by semicolons.ach declaration includes a CSS property name and a value,
                separated by a colon. Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks 
                are surrounded by curly braces.</p>

            <h3>CSS Selectors</h3>
            <p>CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.</p>
            <p>We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)</li>
                <li>Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)</li>
                <li>Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)</li>
                <li>Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)</li>
                <li>Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)</li>

            <h3>The CSS element Selector</h3>
            <p>The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.</p>

            <h3>The CSS Grouping Selector</h3>
            <p>The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.</p>

            <h3>CSS Color Names</h3>
            <p>In CSS, a color can be specified by using a predefined color name.</p>
        <hr/>
            <h3>CSS background-color</h3>
            <p>The background-color property specifies the background color of an element.</p>

            <h3>CSS background-image</h3>
            <p>The background-image property specifies an image to use as the background of an element. By default, 
                the image is repeated, so it covers the entire element.</p>

            <h3>CSS background-repeat</h3>
            <p>By default, the background-image property repeats an image both horizontally and vertically. Some images
                should be repeated only horizontally or vertically.</p>

            <h3>Background-position-x</h3>
            <p>The background-position-x property sets the position of a background image on the x-axis.</p>

            <h3>Background-position-y</h3>
            <p>The background-position-y property sets the position of a background image on the y-axis.</p>

        <section id="textcolor">
            <h3>Text color</h3>
            <p>The color property is used to set the color of the text. The color is specified by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a color name - like "red"</li>
                <li>a HEX value - like "#ff0000"</li>

            </ul>

            <h3>Text Alignment</h3>
            <p>The text-align property is used to set the horizontal alignment of a text.A text can be left or right
                aligned, centered, or justified.When the text-align property is set to "justify", each line is
                stretched so that every line has equal width, and the left and right margins are straight (like in 
                magazines and newspapers)</p>

            <h3>Text Align Last</h3>
            <p>The text-align-last property specifies how to align the last line of a text.</p>

            <h3>Text Direction</h3>
            <p>The direction and unicode-bidi properties can be used to change the text direction of an element.</p>

            <p>The text-decoration-style property is used to set the style of the decoration line.</p>

            <h3>The Shorthand Property</h3>
            <p>The text-decoration property is a shorthand property for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>text-decoration-line (required)</li>
                <li>text-decoration-color (optional)</li>

        <hr/>
            <h3>Text Transformation</h3>
            <p>The text-transform property is used to specify uppercase and lowercase letters in a text.It can be
                used to turn everything into uppercase or lowercase letters, or capitalize the first letter of each
                word.</p>

        <section id="font">
            <h3>The CSS font-family Property</h3>
            <p>In CSS, we use the font-family property to specify the font of a text.</p>

            <h3>CSS Font Style</h3>
            <p>he font-style property is mostly used to specify italic text.This property has three values:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>normal - The text is shown normally</li>
                <li>italic - The text is shown in italics</li>
                <li>oblique - The text is "leaning" (oblique is very similar to italic, but less supported)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Font Weight</h3>
            <p>The font-weight property specifies the weight of a font,</p>

            <h3>Font Size</h3>
            <p>The font-size property sets the size of the text.The font-size value can be an absolute, or relative
                size.</p>
        <hr/>
            <p>Absolute size:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sets the text to a specified size</li>
                <li>Does not allow a user to change the text size in all browsers (bad for accessibility reasons)</li>
                <li>Absolute size is useful when the physical size of the output is known</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Relative size:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sets the size relative to surrounding elements</li>
                <li>Allows a user to change the text size in browsers</li>
            </ul>
        <hr/>
            <h3>Set Font Size With Em</h3>
            <p>To allow users to resize the text (in the browser menu), many developers use em instead of pixels.</p>

            <h3>Styling Links</h3>
            <p>Links can be styled with any CSS property (e.g. color, font-family, background, etc.).In addition,
                links can be styled differently depending on what state they are in.</p>
            <p>The four links states are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a:link - a normal, unvisited link</li>
                <li>a:visited - a link the user has visited</li>
                <li>a:hover - a link when the user mouses over it</li>
                <li>a:active - a link the moment it is clicked</li>
            </ul>

            <p>When setting the style for several link states, there are some order rules:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited</li>
                <li>a:active MUST come after a:hover</li>

            <p>Margin is the space between the border and the surrounding elements. Padding is the space between the content of the element and its border.
                Block Elements use an extra line above and below and they can have margin and padding to keep distance from all surrounding elements.
                Inline Elements stay in the line with their neighboring elements and only keep distance to the elements on the left and on the right
                if a positive margin and/or padding is defined. </p>

                div {
                background-color: radial-gradient(circle, white, green);
                }
                Transitions
                Define the style classes for a transition of the background-color from "yellow" to "aqua" and back when hovering
                div {
                background-color: yellow;
                transition: background-color;

            <h3>Animations</h3>
            <p>
                Define an animation for moving a div element of a fixed size from top right to center to top left with a natural appearance.
                @keyframes animdiv {
                    0% {
                    translate: 100%, 100%;
                    }
                    50% {
                    translate: 50%, 50%;
                    }
                    100% {
                    translate: -100%; 100%;
                    }
                }

                div {
                animation-name: animdiv;
                animation-duration: 5s;
                animation-iteration-count: 1;
                }
            </p>

            <h3>Transformations</h3>
            <p>
                Define a style for translating for 25% in both directions, rotating it for 35 degree and making it one quater of its size taller
                div {
                transform: translate(25%, 25%) rotate(35deg) scaleY(1.25);
                }
            </p>
            <h3>Shadows and Rounded Corners</h3>
            <p>
                Define a style that renders an element as ellipse or cirlce and applies an inner glow on the top and left border of a div in an orange color. The style shall also color the border of the element in a dark variant of the glow color.
                div {
                border-radius: 50%;
                box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px orange inset;

                }
                Positioning
                Define a style the keeps an element always at the same position, even when the page is scrolled
                div {
                position: fixed;
                }

            <h3>Bootstrap Pagination</h3>
            <p>
                We use a large block of connected links for our pagination, making links hard to miss and easily scalable—all while providing large hit areas. Pagination is built with list HTML elements so screen readers can announce the number of available links. Use a wrapping nav element to identify it as a navigation section to screen readers and other assistive technologies.
                In addition, as pages likely have more than one such navigation section, it’s advisable to provide a descriptive aria-label for the nav to reflect its purpose. For example, if the pagination component is used to navigate between a set of search results, an appropriate label could be aria-label="Search results pages".
            </p>

            <h3>Bootstrap Carousel</h3>
            <p>
                The carousel is a slideshow for cycling through a series of content, built with CSS 3D transforms and a bit of JavaScript. It works with a series of images, text, or custom markup. It also includes support for previous/next controls and indicators.
                In browsers where the Page Visibility API is supported, the carousel will avoid sliding when the webpage is not visible to the user (such as when the browser tab is inactive, the browser window is minimized, etc.).
                Please be aware that nested carousels are not supported, and carousels are generally not compliant with accessibility standards.
                Lastly, if you’re building our JavaScript from source, it requires util.js
                Carousels don’t automatically normalize slide dimensions. As such, you may need to use additional utilities or custom styles to appropriately size content. While carousels support previous/next controls and indicators, they’re not explicitly required. Add and customize as you see fit.
                Be sure to set a unique id on the .carousel for optional controls, especially if you’re using multiple carousels on a single page.
            </p>

            <h3>Bootstrap Navbar</h3>
            <p>
                Navbars require a wrapping .navbar with .navbar-expand{-sm|-md|-lg|-xl} for responsive collapsing and color scheme classes.
                Navbars and their contents are fluid by default. Use optional containers to limit their horizontal width.
                Use our spacing and flex utility classes for controlling spacing and alignment within navbars.
                Navbars are responsive by default, but you can easily modify them to change that. Responsive behavior depends on our Collapse JavaScript plugin.
                Navbars are hidden by default when printing. Force them to be printed by adding .d-print to the .navbar. See the display utility class.
                Ensure accessibility by using a nav element or, if using a more generic element such as a div, add a role="navigation" to every navbar to explicitly identify it as a landmark region for users of assistive technologies.
